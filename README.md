# what & why?

Indoor measuring of Co2 and Temperature

Especially in office environments employees are sensitive to high levels of Co2 and/or uncomfortably with hot office temperatures.

The software reads the data from TFA-Dostmann sensors. It can then
* output real-time values\
* Output CSV values
* Act as a [netdata](https://www.netdata.cloud/) plugin

# requirements

## hardware

1) Multiple CO2 Sensors are supported:

    - [TFA-Dostmann AirControl Mini CO2 MessgerÃ¤t](http://www.amazon.de/dp/B00TH3OW4Q) -- 65 euro (sends encrypted data)
    - [TFA-Dostmann AIRCO2NTROL Coach CO2 Monitor](http://www.amazon.de/dp/B07R4XM9Z6) -- 72 euro (sends unencrypted data)

2) [Raspberry PI 2 Model B](http://www.amazon.de/dp/B00T2U7R7I) -- 40 euro

3) case, 5v power supply, microSD card

## software

Download [Raspbian](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/) and [install it on the microSD](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/README.md).

# installation on the raspberry

0) Boot the raspberry with the raspbian and configure according to your needs.

At the moment, monitor.py renders the graphs to _/var/www/html/images_, and creates the RRD database in _/var/local/monitor/co2-temp.rrd_.

To change this, change the variables *RRDDB_LOC* and *GRAPHOUT_DIR* in monitor.py.

monitor.py should not run as root, so we create a service user (the group for this user is created automatically by adduser):

```
sudo adduser --home /var/local/monitor --shell /usr/sbin/nologin --disabled-password monitor
```


2) Copy monitor.py and the webinterface to their location:

```
sudo cp monitor.py /usr/bin
sudo mv /var/www/html/index.html /var/www/html/index.nginx-debian.html
sudo rsync -av --progress web/* /var/www/html
sudo mkdir /var/www/html/images
sudo chown -R monitor: /var/www/html/images
```

3) fix device permissions

The python script reading the sensor should not run as root, so the device permissions need to be set accordingly.

For a non-permanent fix run as root:

```
sudo chmod a+rw /dev/hidraw0
```

The better way to deal with this situation is to set the permissions using udev rules.

We want to set only the really needed permissions on the device, therefor the udev-rule should only apply to the specific device, or product which is announced by the device when USB initializes it.

To get the product name the bus and device id from *lsusb* is needed:

```
lsusb
Bus 001 Device 004: ID 04d9:a052 Holtek Semiconductor, Inc.
```

With this information the product name can be read from udevadm, using the bus id *001* and the device id *004* like this:

```
udevadm info -a -p $(udevadm info -q path -n /dev/bus/usb/001/004) | grep product
    ATTR{product}=="USB-zyTemp"
```

The product name is in this case *USB-zyTemp* which can be used in the udev rule:

```
echo 'ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{product}=="USB-zyTemp", MODE="0664", GROUP="monitor"' > /etc/udev/rules.d/40-hidrwaw.rules
```

After plugging the TFA device in, at least one device file (e.g. /dev/hidraw0) should be generated with the correct permissions.

4) run the script

monitor.py can be tested by invoking:
```
sudo -u monitor monitor.py -p /dev/hidraw0
```

We need to run it as `monitor` user because by default RRD databse is located in the folder where only `monitor` user has access to and access to a socket was granted to monitor group.

5) run on startup

The cronjob can be added to /etc/crontab like this:

```
*/3 *   * * *   monitor /usr/bin/monitor.py -p /dev/hidraw0 -n 1
```

# todo

* configure RRD database location and graph directory
* mobile webinterface navigation
* configuring webinterface strings
* notification via email
